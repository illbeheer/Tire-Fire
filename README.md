Project 1

Technologies used : CSS, HTML, JS, SASS, MATERIALIZE
Strain API, and Giphy API

Description: Be able to search any marijuana strain and get back the name, race, and a brief description of it

user stories:
be able to search marijuana strains
be able to get information about searched marijuana strain

Challenges:
We had a hard time getting the api to respond, but we worked out the kinks by using a different coding method. instead of .append we decided to use .html to overwrite the html file so itll replace the previous text in the html file.

in the future we want to make it even more responsive, and make it overal look sleeker and have a simple yet elegant design. and possibly implement more api's such as Yelp and Mapbox. so as to get the nearest dispensary information via yelp and directions to that dispensary via mapbox
